======================

This is our source controlled and reduced version of the Google App Engine SDK for Python

we needed this for our own work so we would not be downloading zips all the time from Google and did not find an existing github mirror of their SVN code and could not find an easy way of directly checking out just a particular version with SVN, and we preferred to manage it all with git. 

we will be removing some libraries we dont use from the SDK so we dont have such a huge set of files

You should download the official SDK from Google https://developers.google.com/appengine/downloads
